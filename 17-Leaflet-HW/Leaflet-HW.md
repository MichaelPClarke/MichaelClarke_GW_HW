### Your Mission
ANSWERS BELOW: 

To give the class a break after projects, this assignment has been slightly amended. The solution has been provided to you, and your task is to analyze the code and explain a few component of the solution. Here are the topics to address:
1.	Briefly explain the logic for generating the base map.
   -We are using the mapbox API, so we have to pull in the config key and set the variable for the basemap by pulling in the tileLayers from Mapbox in lines 6, 17 & 26. From there we set a map variable in line 37, use leaflet to identify it as a map and set where it will be centered and how zoomed in it will be. In line 42, the tile layer variables are added to the map variable.
2.	Describe how the JSON was loaded and how was the data traversed. Explain how was the information from the JSON used to render data on the map. 
   - The JSON data has geodata within it. We use d3 to identify the data as json in line 76 and create a function in line 81 where we assign colors and radii using feature.properties.mag from the json data. The data is identified as geojson data in line 122 using leaflet. 
3.	Explain the logic for generating the circles and amending the size of them. What does this communicate?
   - The function getColor is used to adjust colors based on the magnitudes using case and return based on the data values. The size has to be amended to return 0 magnitude as 1 as shown in lines 113-115.
4.	Describe how the layer for the Tectonic plates was generated.
   - A tectonic plates variable is created as a new layer group in line 50 and then identified as an overlay in line 63. The tectonic plate data is then added in line 173 using d3.json where it is assigned colors and added to the tectonic plates layer from above.
5.	What are the components in the layer control? How were they generated? 
   - These are identified as overlays in the overlays variable after creating new layer groups in lines 50 & 51. They are then added using leaflet as controls as overlays as they are identified in L.control.layers as the second variable where overlays go (basemaps are first) and added to the map variable.
6.	Explain the difference between the base map (tile layer) and the data layer(s).
   - The base maps are simply pulled in using the mapbox documentation (graymap, satellite and outdoors). The data layers are the overlays, called 2nd in the leaflet control and overlaid on top of the basemaps as they are called 2nd in the control. The data is called using the built in d3 capabilities to identify data from a json and assign them to variables.
7.	Walk through the logic of how the legend was generated and rendered on the page.
   - Legend.onAdd is used. The number of grades in the legend is identified in the grades variable in line 151 and the colors of those grades are identified in the colors variable in line 152. A for loop is created for the grades and looped through the length of the grades variable created, html code is added to it for formatting and ease of use in the html page and then it is added to the map in line 170.

### General Description

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Before You Begin

1. Add a folder to your homework repository called `leaflet-challenge`.

2. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **Leaflet-Step-1** and **Leaflet-Step-2**.

3. This homeworks utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Your Task

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

![2-BasicMap](Images/2-BasicMap.png)

Your first task is to visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get your data set**

   ![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

   * Your visualization should look something like the map above.

### Level 2: More Data 

![5-Advanced](Images/5-Advanced.png)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

In this step we are going to..

* Plot a second data set on our map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.

### Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* The overall thoughtfulness, clarity, and completeness of your writeup

**Good luck!**
